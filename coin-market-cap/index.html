    <h3>Coin Market Cap (CMC) Plugin</h3>
    <p><strong>The Coin Market Cap (CMC) plugin</strong> is a powerful WordPress plugin for integrating live
        cryptocurrency market data into WordPress websites. It connects to a third-party API to generate an automatic
        crypto price listing that includes <em>real-time value, coin market cap, tickers,</em> and <em>charts</em>. You
        can select which data to show and sort it based on rank or volume. Furthermore, each cryptocurrency links to a
        single page created by default. You can customize its appearance using <code>shortcodes</code> or custom HTML.
