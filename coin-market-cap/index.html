    <p>The <strong>Coin Market Cap plugin</strong> is a powerful plugin for integrating live cryptocurrency market data
        into WordPress websites. It connects to a third-party API to generate an automatic crypto price listing that
        includes real-time value, market cap, tickers, and charts. You can select which data to display and sort it by
        rank or volume. Each cryptocurrency links to a single page created automatically, and you can customize its
        appearance using <code>shortcodes</code> or custom <code>HTML</code>.</p>
